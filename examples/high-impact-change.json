    "description": "Jumpstarter now requires privileged container access for direct hardware interaction. This change adds a custom service account with elevated RBAC permissions, modifies the security context to allow privileged execution, and enables host network access. The task will need to mount /dev/usb and /sys/class for device management. These changes are necessary for USB device flashing and low-level hardware control in our CI/CD pipeline.",
